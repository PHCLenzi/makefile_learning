The main objective of this lab is to create makefiles for cross-compiling some algorithms to run on a QEMU virtual machine emulating an x64 processor.

Steps of this lab:
1 - Set up the environment with QEMU x64, a C++ compiler, etc.
2 - Create some makefiles to build this C++ project.
3 - Use these makefiles to build the project.
4 - Run this project on the QEMU virtual machine.
